# How to Play
The object is to get the player to the water without being hit by the enemy bugs.

## Moving the Player
You move the player with the arrow keys on the keyboard. When the player reaches the water - you win! If you get hit by a bug you lose and go back to the starting position.
When you get to the botton of the screen or the left or right edge of the screen you won't be able to move any further in that direction.

* Hitting the up arrow moves the player one row up towards the water.
* Hitting the down arrow moves the player one row down toward the bottom of the screen.
* Hitting the left arrow moves the player one column to the left.
* Hitting the right arrow moves the player one column to the right.
